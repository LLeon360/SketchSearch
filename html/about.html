            <h1>Deep Learning Powered Image Search</h1>
            <h2>A novel and fun way to search for images.</h2>
            <h3>What is it?</h3>
            <p>
                Sketch Search uses a deep learning model to classify a
                user drawing and search for the predicted item. To do this,
                the model takes the classification and queries online through Bing to 
                retrieve matching images.
            </p>
            <h3>About the Deep Learning AI Model</h3>
            <p>
                The deep learning model used is a deep convolutional neural network
                made up of convolutional layers which each utilize a sliding kernel
                multiplication on the input to identify specific features. These layers
                pass their processed output called the feature maps to the next and as
                the model gets deeper with more layers, the feature maps identify more
                specific features instead of the broader features. For example, a
                convolutional neural network may start by identifying edges or circles
                in early layers and then piece them together to identify a final class
                later on. The sliding kernel moves across and multiplies with the input
                image is trained over many epochs on training data of user drawings to
                determine what weights or values in the kernal work best to identify
                distinguishing features.
            </p>
            <h3>The Training Data</h3>
            <p>
                The model is trained using Google's Quick Draw dataset consisting of millions
                of user drawings of 345 different things (classes) that the model is able
                to train on to classify. The data is open source <a
                    href="https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com/data">here</a>.
                For the model used, the classes were vetted to remove proper nouns for the
                model to identify general everyday things and spiders were removed in case
                anyone was arachnophobic. The images used to train the model were also a
                much smaller subset of the millions of images to make sure training time
                was short which meant using around 5,000 image per class (type of object).
