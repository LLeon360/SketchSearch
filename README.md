# SketchSearch
This is a web application that allows a user to sketch a doodle to search for a image. An AI model will recognize the drawing and retrieve images that match the query. This app provides an AI powered search result differing from Google's image search engine which retrieves visually similar images rather than recognizing the object itself.
This application can be used for an early learning experience and help with young children's recognition of objects.
